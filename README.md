## Description
Conditional rendering in ReactJS refers to displaying different UI elements or components based on a certain condition. It's like using JavaScript conditions (like if, else, or ternary operators) to decide what should be shown or hidden in the component's render.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository and install the dependencies
```bash
npm install
```
2. Start the frontend application locally
```bash
npm start
```
